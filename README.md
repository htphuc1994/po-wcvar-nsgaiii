# wavelet based CVaR

- Main file: po-wcvar-transaction-fee.py, So run this file.
- Consider drawing portfolio returns - variance/VaR/CVaR to illustrate
- Test investments of quarterly, half, and yearly periods, hence adjust wavelet transform scales smoother for longer periods (perhaps WAVELET_LEVEL=1;2;3 respectively)
